# ComputerArchProject (Needs a real name)

This project will use MyHDL (http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/manual/intro.html), which is a implementation of a Hardware Description Language within Python.

Using MyHDL allows for the flexiblity and ease of use of Python, with strict hardware concepts like combinational logic found in VHDL/Verilog.

# Install MyHDL
MyHDL can be installed using "pip install myhdl". You must first have pip installed on your machine. This might also work with easy_install, but pip worked fine the first try.
